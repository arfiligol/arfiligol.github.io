# 🎯The Most Important Core Skills of a Top-Tier Data Analyst

## 1️⃣ First Principles Thinking
> [!important] Why is it important?

- Data analysis is not just about running models or tuning parameters; it's about deeply understanding "How is this data generated?", "What does this data truly represent?", and "How can we extract real-world laws from the data?"
- A true top-tier data analyst does not blindly rely on existing tools but starts from first principles, breaking down problems and reconstructing solutions.
- For example, in quantum physics, analyzing the distortion of superconducting qubits is not just about fitting data. You need to understand the physical background (such as decoherence and noise coupling) and design appropriate data processing methods based on physical mechanisms.
